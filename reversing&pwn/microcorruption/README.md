I've been meaning to do the microcorruption challenges for a while, but decided to start now because of my growing interest in reverse engineering and binary exploitation. The microcorruption challenges are well polished and beginner friendly. The assembler used in the challenges consists of only few instructions, and you can learn most of what you need to know by reading the [manual](https://microcorruption.com/manual.pdf), and going through the tutorial.

I hope to use the challenges to learn about memory corruption vulnerabilities and reverse engineering. I might even end up writing some C to [target MSP430](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP430-GCC-OPENSOURCE) along the way.
